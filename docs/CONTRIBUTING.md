The below steps describe development on Windows. The app is currently not supported on other operating systems. 

## Architecture
Once I drew the structure of the application in Excalidraw. You can see that below. It's a rough overview of the key parts and may be a useful overview for any interested developers.

You can find the source in the `design.excalidraw` file in this directory.

## Start in Development Mode
Development mode benefits from the infrastructure offered by [electron-react-boilerplate](https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate). You can read more about it on their [docs](https://electron-react-boilerplate.js.org/). It allows for a very quick development cycle, access to chrome dev tools, and hot reloading of the app on saving new changes. 

1. Install the latest version of Node.js version (latest at time of writing is 20.4.0) from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).
1. Clone a copy of the [wow-recorder](https://github.com/aza547/wow-recorder) codebase.
1. Change into the checkout directory. 
1. Run `npm install` on the command line to install required node packages.
1. Run `npm start` to launch the application in development mode.

## Building, Packaging and Releasing
> As of 3.3.1, we have CI builds for all commits to main.
1. Build the electron application.
    1. Update the version number in `./release/app/package.json` if appropriate.  
    1. Run `npm run package` to build the electron application. 
1. Install the .exe and run the tests to make sure you've not broken something crass.
    1. With WarcraftRecorder open, run: `python .\resources\test-scripts\all_tests.py`.
    1. Manually check the app behaves as expected while this runs.
        1. Recordings are created.
        1. Appropriate metadata is created.
        1. User experience has not degraded.
1. Share the application.
    1. Update the CHANGELOG.md with the new version number and change details. 
    1. Commit and push all changes.
    1. Tag a release on GitHub and attach the built files:
      - `./release/build/WarcraftRecorder Setup X.Y.Z.exe` to enable installation.
      - `./release/build/latest.yml` to allow the auto updater to function. 

## Tests
1. Run `npm test` to run the UTs. 
    1. These are `jest` based unit tests. 
    2. Note: This is a WIP - the UTs currently are not useful.
2. To run end-to-end tests (requires some hardcoded path updates):
    * All tests: `python .\resources\test-scripts\all_tests.py`.
    * Individual test: `python  .\resources\test-scripts\retail_mythic_plus.py`.

## Debugging Mode
You can use VSCode's JavaScript Debug terminal to step through the code, add breakpoints, view variables and the other IDE features.  

1. Go to file, new terminal. 
1. Click the arrow next to the "+" icon. 
1. Select "JavaScrtip Debug Terminal". See below image.
1. Run the application in development mode as per above instructions (i.e. `npm start`).
1. Enjoy the ability to use the IDE features.

## Debugging in Production with Dev Tools
From [here](https://electron-react-boilerplate.js.org/docs/packaging).

`npx cross-env DEBUG_PROD=true npm run package`

## Building OSN
> Advice is not to build this and just get it from the folks at Streamlabs. I built it once, it was a total faff.
> If you really need to build it, you can probably find some useful notes in the history of this doc. 
> This is hosted by streamlabs here (note version number): 
> - https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/obsstudionodes3.streamlabs.com/osn-0.23.59-release-win64.tar.gz

Below are various additional OSN resources:

- [Streamlabs Desktop](https://github.com/stream-labs/desktop)
- [AdvancedRecordingFactory API](https://github.com/stream-labs/obs-studio-node/pull/1128)
- [OSN Tests](https://github.com/stream-labs/obs-studio-node/tree/staging/tests/osn-tests/src)

## Microsoft Stamp of Approval
If we just build a .exe and release it Windows will warn it may be dangerous. Could resolve this buy purchasing a certificate from a CA, but it costs a fortune. Read more about it in this [issue](https://github.com/aza547/wow-recorder/issues/11).
1. Submit it for analysis [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/filesubmission) after releasing it to make that warning go away.
    1. Select "Microsoft Defender Smartscreen" as the security product. 
    1. "Company name" - just put your own name. 
    1. "Do you have a Microsoft support case number?" - No.
    1. Leave next few fields blank/unchanged. 
    1. Select & upload the .exe. 
    1. "What do you believe this file is?" - Incorrectly detected as malware/malicious
    1. Detection name - "WarcraftRecorder.Setup.2.0.1.exe"
    1. "Additional information" - whatever, I'm sure no one will read it. 
1. This isn't instant but seems to get resolved within 24 hours, that seems good enough.
